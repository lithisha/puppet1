Part 1
Time to Complete 
Approximately 45 Minutes

Replace xx with the IP address of the VM that you have been assigned.

In this lab you will create a new container with puppet agent installed and having an assigned static IP address. The followings are the overview of the tasks to be performed:

●	Create a container
●	Install puppet agent and commonly used packages
●	Create image
●	Create new container from image
●	Create docker custom network
●	Assign static IP to client container


 

You should have already set up Puppet Enterprise (PE) on you VM. If not yet, please refer to lesson 1 and complete the PE setup.

1.	On your VM, open Terminal and enter the following command to login as a superuser.

root@sddo-vm:  su
*password: ubuntu

To add an entry or modify the hosts file, simply run the commands below to open the hosts file.

root@sddo-vm:  nano /etc/hosts

Make the change to the hosts file as per below (yellow highlight).

 

Save the file and exit. 




2. Prepare a puppet-agent container image

2.1 Create a new container 

root@sddo-vm:  docker run -it puppetclient1 ubuntu:18.04 /bin/bash


 
2.2 On new container, Install useful packages

Fill in the purpose of the following each package:

Package Name
	Purpose
curl
	
wget
	
vim
	
iputils-ping
	
net-tools
	
openssh-server
	


root@puppetclient:  apt-get update

root@puppetclient:  apt-get install curl wget vim iputils-ping net-tools openssh-server


2.3 On the new container, install puppet-agent

root@puppetclient1:  wget --content-disposition 'https://pm.puppetlabs.com/puppet-agent/2021.5.0/7.14.0/repos/deb/bionic/puppet7/puppet-agent_7.14.0-1bionic_amd64.deb'

root@puppetclient:  dpkg -i puppet-agent_7.14.0-1bionic_amd64.deb


2.4 Save container as image to local docker repository

root@sddo-vm:  docker commit puppetclient1 puppetclient1

 
2.5 Create a docker custom network
root@sddo-vm:  docker network create –subnet=192.168.100.0/24 customnetwork

View your custom network information
root@sddo-vm:  docker network inspect customnetwork

 


 
3. Create new container (with puppet-agent installed)

root@sddo-vm:  docker run -d --privileged -h “puppetclient.localdomain” - -name puppetclient1  - -add-host “sddo-vm.localdomain:172.20.113.92”  - -ip “192.168.100.3” puppetclient /sbin/init

(Note: Yellow hightlignted IP address is your Puppet Master)
For the various option used in docker run command, refer to https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/


3.1 Verify the yellow highlight texts are already in the /etc/hosts file of the container.
(sddo-vm.localdomain’s IP address should be your VM’s IP address)

root@puppetclient:  cat /etc/hosts

 

3.2 Configure puppet client setting
root@puppetclient:  vim /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.conf

Add the following texts (yellow highlight) into the file
 


 

4. Register the puppet agent with the puppet master.

4.1 On the client node (Puppet Agent), sends its first request.
root@puppetclient1:  /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent -t

 


4.2 On the server node (Puppet Master), list all the available certificates. Notice that the cert from the client node (puppetclient) is now shown.

On the server node (Puppet Master), list all the certificates. 
root@sddo-vm: /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppetserver ca list --all

 

Sign the requested certificates.
root@sddo-vm:  /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppetserver ca sign –all

 

 
5. On the client node (puppetclient1), use the following command to test the communication between the server and client node.

root@puppetclient1:  /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet agent –t

 


6. Extend your path variable to include the puppet command

In the container, edit ~/.bashrc file to make permanent modifications. Use a text editor like nano to open the file

root@puppetclient1:  nano ~/.bashrc

append the file with the following
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/puppetlabs/bin

Force changes in current terminal session
root@puppetclient1: .  ~/.bashrc

root@puppetclient1:  echo $PATH
 

Test puppet command can be issued from any folder.
root@puppetclient1:  puppet agent -t
(There should be error in the output)
 



You have successful setup a container with puppet-agent running, assigned static IP address. We will use this container in subsequent lessons.



Part 2

Time to Complete 
Approximately 15 Minutes

Now, you should be able to create another puppet agent container. Based on the following information, create another puppet agent container.

Container Information	Setting	Remark
Container Name	puppetclient2	
Docker image	puppetclient-image	Image was created earlier in this lab
Container IP Address	192.168.0.4	
Custom Network	customnetwork	192.168.100.0/24
Container Hostname	puppetclient2.localdomain	
Puppet Master	sddo-vm.localdomain	
Privileged Container	Yes
